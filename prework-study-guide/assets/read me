# <Preston's Prework Study guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation behind this prework study guide is that this is my first ever time working with things like VS code and Git. This is the just the start of my new career path
- I built this because this is my foot in the door of the coding world (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- this solves the issue of not having a study guide for all the prework we did before the course starts
- I learned how to use Git Bash, CSS, JS, and HTML. learned how they work and whats its purpose is for websites.
